This is an iOS app for students of J. Sterling Morton East High School. It's primary feature is a scrollable UITableView style feed, customized to display news and updates from school faculty, extracurricular activities and admnistrators. Typical feed items will be FB, Twitter, TUMBLR and Instagram posts (clicking one will show details and clicking again will open the post's URL in Safari or the associated app. Custom notifications (not from a social media site) will also be possible through a Django form. Once a stable beta has been developed, push notifications will be added for urgent notifications, eg: "School is on fire, don't come in today."

It's written for iOS 7 (may be rewriting it in Swift for iOS). It features a Django backend (commited under another name) which will scrape and store the latest social media posts, accept manual input/editing from admins, tally hits for each item and serve as a cross-platform API endpoint for the iOS app and (eventual) Android app.

The project is codenamed after the character Fat Tony from The Simpsons,  voiced by Joe Montegna, an alumn of Morton East High School in Cicero, Illinois.

Any questions, comments, concerns should be directed to myself at adanasandoval@gmail.com

Please don't laugh at my code.
