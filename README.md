FatTony
=======
FatTony is a codename for the iOS app currently in development. 
  
This app is for students of J. Sterling Morton East High School. It's primary feature is a simple 'RSS' style feed, customized to display news and updates from school faculty, extracurricular activities and admnitrators. Typical feed items will be FB, Twitter, TUMBLR and Instagram posts (clicking one will show details and clicking again will open the post's URL in Safari or the associated app. Custom notifications (not from a social media site) will also be possible through a Django form.

Once a stable beta has been developed, push notifications will be added for urgent notifications, eg: "School is on fire, don't come in today."

It's codenamed after Fat Tony from The Simpsons, who is voiced by Joe Montegna, who attended Morton East High School in Cicero, Illinois.

Please don't laugh at my code.
